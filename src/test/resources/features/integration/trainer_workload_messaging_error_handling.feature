Feature: Trainer Workload Messaging Error Handling
  As a system
  I want to ensure that error cases in workload messaging are properly handled
  So that the system remains robust and reliable

  Scenario: Handle invalid message format
    When an invalid workload message is sent to the queue
    Then the message should be sent to the dead letter queue
    And an error response should be generated

  Scenario: Handle missing required fields in workload message
    When a workload message with missing required fields is sent
    Then the message should be sent to the dead letter queue
    And an error response should be generated with validation details

  Scenario: Handle database errors during message processing
    Given the database connection is unavailable
    When a valid workload message is sent
    Then an error response should indicate database connection issues
