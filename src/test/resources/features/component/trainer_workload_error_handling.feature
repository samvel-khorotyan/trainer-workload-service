Feature: Trainer Workload Error Handling
  As a system administrator
  I want to ensure proper error handling in workload processing
  So that the system remains stable and reliable

  Background:
    Given a trainer with username "john.doe", first name "John", last name "Doe" and active status "true"

  Scenario: Handle database connection failure
    Given the database is unavailable
    When I process a "ADD" workload command for username "john.doe" with date "2023-05-15" and duration 60
    Then a database error should occur

  Scenario: Handle missing required fields
    When I process a workload command with missing required fields
    Then a validation error should occur with message "Required fields are missing"
